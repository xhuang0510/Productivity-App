Application Still Under Construction

Created by Xinjie Huang, Avi Dixit, and Neil Arora over Winter Break 2020

Description: 
A React Productivity Web Application designed for students. Main function of the app is to take a user inputted To Do list and generate a time table schedule for the user to complete their To Do list. 

Functionality:
1. Sign up for a new account, log in to an exisiting account, or continue as a guest (guest users have limited functionality)
2. Take an intro survey which documents study habits, average time to complete various study tasks, and other preferences.
3. On the right, there are sticky notes which can be created, deleted, or pinned to the top of the row. These stickies are saved if an account is created
4. On the left, there are buttons for various pages and settings:
   a. Stats: Shows the users history such as time spent using the app, days completed, ect.
   b. Acheivements: Displays various acheivements the user can earn like DuoLingo has. Ex: "Logged Everyday for a Week."
   c. Options: User can adjust options for the app.
   d. About: About the three creators of the application.
   e. Light/Dark Mode Toggle: Toggles light mode or dark mode.
5. In the middle is where the application shows different menus. By default, it is on the schedule. If you click any of the other buttons in the left menu, the middle menu will    change to the selected menu.
6. Create a To Do list and the application will use an algorithm based on inputted values to create a time table for the day that can be adjusted or downloaded as a .csv by the user
7. After each completed day, there is a short exit survey which improves the algorithms timings the for the next use.


How to Use (for Temporary Build):
1. Download the full project to a folder. 
2. Open the App.js file in the terminal
3. Run 'npm install' to install dependencies
4. Run 'npm start' to start the application.
5. Enjoy!
